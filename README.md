# web-security-proxy-lab
This project demonstrates how web proxies can intercept and modify HTTP requests and responses, simulating potential security threats. Using an Apache web server with PHP-based login forms, various attacks and modifications were tested through Burp Suite, ZAP, and Fiddler to understand request tampering, cookie injection, and traffic interception.
