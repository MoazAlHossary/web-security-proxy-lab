# Fiddler Interception Log

## 1. Intercepting HTTP Traffic  
- Captured an **HTTP request** to `http://example.com`.  
- All headers and body content were visible in **plaintext**.
- Demonstrates why **unencrypted HTTP is vulnerable** to Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks.

## 2. Intercepting HTTPS Traffic (Without Certificate Installed)  
- Attempted to capture traffic from `https://youtube.com`.  
- Headers were partially visible, but content was **encrypted and unreadable**.  
- **SSL/TLS encryption prevents MITM attacks** unless the attacker installs a forged certificate.

## 3. Key Differences Between HTTP and HTTPS  
| Feature      | HTTP Traffic        | HTTPS Traffic |
|-------------|---------------------|--------------|
| Visibility  | Fully readable       | Encrypted   |
| Security    | No encryption        | TLS protection |
| MITM Risk   | High                 | Low |
