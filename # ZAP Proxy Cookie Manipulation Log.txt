# ZAP Proxy Cookie Manipulation Log

## 1. Adding a Set-Cookie Header  
- Intercepted a response and inserted a `Set-Cookie` header:

Set-Cookie: User=mfrfmh; Path=/; SameSite=Strict

- The cookie now **prevents XSS** by restricting JavaScript access (`HttpOnly`).
- Adding `Secure` ensures it only works over HTTPS.


## 2. Expired Cookie Injection  
- Set a `Set-Cookie` header with an **old expiration date**:

Set-Cookie: User=mfrfmh; Expires=Wed, 01 Jan 1970 00:00:00 GMT


- Browser **immediately deleted the cookie**, demonstrating how session hijacking attempts can be prevented.

## 3. Modifying Cookie Attributes  
- Changed cookie flags to:
Set-Cookie: User=mfrfmh; Secure; HttpOnly; SameSite=Strict

- Ensured it was restricted to **HTTPS only**, preventing interception in plaintext traffic.
