# Burp Suite HTTP Request Manipulation Log

## 1. Changing Hostname to www.google.com  
- Modified the "Host" header from `127.0.0.1` to `www.google.com`.  
- Server still processed the request because Burp does not alter the actual routing unless configured with DNS spoofing.  
- Demonstrates **Host Header Injection** vulnerability.

## 2. GET Requests with Nonstandard Headers & HTTP Versions  
- Added **custom headers** and switched from HTTP/1.1 to HTTP/1.0.  
- Response: `200 OK`, confirming that HTTP/1.0 is less restrictive and allows easier exploitation.  
- Attackers prefer HTTP/1.0 because it lacks **keep-alive** and **modern security features**.

## 3. Changing POST to GET Using Proxy  
- Captured a **POST login request**.  
- Modified the request method to **GET** using Burp Suiteâ€™s "Change Request Method" feature.  
- Server still accepted credentials via GET, revealing a **weak authentication design**.
